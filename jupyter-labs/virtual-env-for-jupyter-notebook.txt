# Virtual Environments for Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter notebook has a default kernel it uses.
To use a notebook within a virtual environment, we need to manually override this kernel with a kernel of our choice (i.e. newly created virtual environment).

1. Create virtual environment as normal
virtualenv .venv
replacing ‘.venv’ with the name you want to give this virtual environment.

Confirm with
pip list

2. Activate the environment using:
source .venv/bin/activate

3. Install Jupyter Notebook into virtual environment
Now we want to (re)install jupyter notebook within this environment using:
python3 -m pip install ipykernel

pip install jupyterlab
jupyter lab
pip install notebook

## To run the jupyter notebook
$ jupyter notebook

4. OPTIONAL: Now install any python package (e.g. openai)
$ python3 -m pip install openai
At this point I expected all parts in place to start working within the virtual environment within the jupyter notebook.
However when I launched a notebook using jupyter notebook I found that the installed modules were not working when imported into the jupyter notebook.

How can it work in our shell but not our notebook?
What is happening is Jupyter Notebook has a default kernel it uses.
We need to manually add our virtual environment as an alternative kernel for Jupyter Notebook to use.

5. Allow Jupyter access to the kernel within our new virtual environment
The final step involves running the following command, which adds the newly created ‘.venv’ environment to the list of accessible kernels for Jupyter Notebook.

python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=.venv
You should receive a confirmation in your bash 
“Installed kernelspec .venv in /Users/USERNAME/Library/Jupyter/kernels”.

After this, launch a new jupyter notebook instance and create a new notebook.
On the toolbar, select ‘Kernel’ and ‘Change Kernel’.
The new kernel should now be available in the list for selection.
Select the name of the new virtual environment, and install modules should be available for importing.


After you are done with the project and no longer need the kernel you can uninstall it by running the following code:
jupyter-kernelspec uninstall .venv
